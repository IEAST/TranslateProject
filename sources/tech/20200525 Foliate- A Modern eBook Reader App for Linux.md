Foliate: A Modern eBook Reader App for Linux
======

_**Brief: Foliate is simple and elegant open source eBook viewer that provides a Kindle-like reading experience on Linux desktop.**_

### Foliate provides modern reading experience on Linux desktop

![][1]

While we already have a list of [best eBook readers for Linux][2], I recently came across another eBook viewer for Linux. It is called [Foliate][3].

Foliate is a modern GTK eBook viewer that offers quite a lot of essential features. If you own an Amazon Kindle or some other eBook reader, you probably miss that kind of reading experience on the desktop.

Foliate addresses those complaints. Foliate shows an estimate of remaining reading time and pages in the book. You can add bookmarks, highlight text and add notes. You can export this data or sync them easily.

You can also look up for words using Wiktionary and Wikipedia. You can switch between two page view and scroll view. It also has several themes to suit you reading preference.

And the best thing is that it is being actively maintained and developed.
